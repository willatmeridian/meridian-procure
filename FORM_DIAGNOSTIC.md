# Form Issues - Quick Fix Steps

You're seeing: **"Sorry, there was an error sending your message. Please try again or contact us directly."**

This means you're still seeing the old HubSpot form component. Here's the fix:

## 🔧 **Step 1: Clear Browser Cache**
1. **Hard refresh** your browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. **Try incognito/private browsing** mode
3. **Clear your browser cache** completely

## 🚀 **Step 2: Deploy Updated Code**
1. **Upload the NEW `/dist` folder** to Netlify 
2. **The new build** (just created) has NO HubSpot components
3. **All forms are now simple Netlify forms**

## 🧪 **Step 3: Test Simple Form First**
Before testing the main contact forms, test the diagnostic form:

**Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/test-form/`**

This simple test form will confirm if Netlify forms are working.

## 📝 **Step 4: Enable Netlify Form Detection**
After deploying, Netlify should automatically detect these forms:
- `contact` (on contact page)
- `quote-request` (on home page and other pages)
- `test-contact` (on test page)

**Check in Netlify Dashboard:**
- Go to your site → Forms tab
- You should see the forms listed there

## 🔍 **Step 5: Verify Form Source Code**
**Right-click on your contact form** → **View Page Source**
- Look for: `<form name="contact" method="POST" netlify="true"`
- Should NOT see any JavaScript `HubSpotContactForm` references

## ✅ **Expected Behavior After Fix:**
1. **Fill out form** → **Click Submit**
2. **Page redirects** to a success page (or refreshes)
3. **Form submission appears** in Netlify dashboard
4. **NO error messages**

## 🆘 **If Forms Still Don't Work:**
1. **Check Netlify build logs** for form detection
2. **Manually add forms** in Netlify dashboard
3. **Contact Netlify support** - their forms are very reliable

## 📧 **Setting Up Email Notifications:**
Once forms work:
1. **Netlify Dashboard** → Site → Forms → Form notifications
2. **Add your email** to get submissions
3. **Test with a real submission**

The updated code I just built has completely removed all HubSpot components and JavaScript dependencies. It should work perfectly once deployed and cached is cleared.
